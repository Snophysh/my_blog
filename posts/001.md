So after entering the [advXjam](https://itch.io/jam/advxjam) I realized just how much I learned from finishing a story. Before this, a lot of my work was left unfinished. Wasting away in folders, never to see the light of an editor again. This also meant I got a ton of experience writing intros and none writing endings. So I made this website for two reasons. Having a place to upload my shorter works and to blog my learning journey.

My goal is to finish at least one piece of work a week. Whether it be micro, flash, short, or novella length. My hope is by this time next year, I'll have grown not only as a writer but an interactive fiction writer. But honestly, I just want to share my stories with the world! Thanks for stopping by.
